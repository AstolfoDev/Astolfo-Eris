# Astolfo.js x Eris
Astolfo.js x Eris was built with speed and user experience in mind. Did I achieve that? Well, yes but actually no.

Speed was great, but user experience, not so much. if you ignore the data rollbacks it was also very spicy, but sadly, data rollbacks do have a big impact on user experience, so in that regard, this Discord bot is a failure, oh yeah and chess doesn't work (my main feature) because when I ported it from Discord.js I didn't really put enough time into making sure it worked with the new Discord API wrapper so yeah.
